# Project Management App

Hey :) 

I've started this project during **EPAM University Program** at .NET Development Training as a final project of training (app development scope 2 weeks - at the time on GitLab).

Below is my coding history of preperation to training and selecting process (3 weeks of solving challenges) and the whole .NET training (6-7 months of learning, coding and solving various of tasks).

I designed a few visualizations of an app.

For management purpose I use Jira, to keep on track, be more familiare with Jira features and practice project management.

***First version was a MVC app but I moved to API approach and presently working on frontend which gonna be based on Angular framework.

Major Ideas to develop in the future:
- Azure Deployment
- Chat Feature with SignalR
- AI assistance which could analize the whole project details and provide some suggestions for Project Managers 
- Enhance projects customization for various management approaches
