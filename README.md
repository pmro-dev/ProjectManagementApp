# Project Management App

Hey :) 

I've started this project during **EPAM University Program** at .NET Development Training as a final project of training (app development scope 2 weeks - at the time on GitLab).

Below is my coding history of preperation to training and selecting process (3 weeks of solving challenges) and the whole .NET training (6-7 months of learning, coding and solving various of tasks).

Because of my interesting and education in Project Management I decided to develop something similar to monday.com:

I designed a few visualizations of app.

For management purpose I use Jira, to keep on track, be more familiare with Jira features and practice project management.

Major Ideas to develop in the future:
- Azure Deployment
- Chat Feature with SignalR
- AI assistance which could analize the whole project details and provide some suggestions for Project Managers 
- Enhance projects customization for various management approaches

Timeline Updates:

@ ... - 31.05.2023 | Project development and commits history slowed down because of preparation to Summer Internship opportunities.

@ 31.05.2023 - 16.10.2023 | It's tough to get on first job, I gained some experience during summer internship's interviews and challenges, but decided to get some work for money during summer that allow me learn more. ;)

@ 17.12.2023 - 03.03.2024 | Project development stucked at that period of time because of I've visited friends in The UK and practiced english conversations. ;)
